We aim to design and optimize a plant for the production of 3-chloro-1-propene (allyl chloride) through the thermal chlorination of propylene at high temperature and relatively low pressure in a fluidized bed reactor. The reactions involved are as follws: <br>

The process goes as follows: <br>
Propylene is heated in a fired heater and mixed with clorine gas in a fluidized bed reactor of high temperature and moderate pressure. The hot product from the reactor, crude ally chloride, is then cooled and sent to the separation section. The crude ally chloride contains no chlorine, carries the unreacted propylene, the main product ally chloride, and some amounts of all the side products, most prominently hydrogen chloride.
