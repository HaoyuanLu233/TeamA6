We are tasked with designing and optimizing a plant for the production of 3-chloro-1-propene (allyl chloride) through the thermal chlorination of propylene at high temperature and moderate pressure in a fluidized bed reactor. The reactions involved are as follws: <br>

The targeted plant production is 20,000 metric ton per year and the product specifications are as follows: <br>

The plant will be comprised of three major sections: the reactor section, the separation section and several refrigeration sections. The reactor section includeds feed heating preparation, the fluidized bed reactor, a cooling cycle for the reactor and cooling preparation for separation. The separation section includes towers that each separates propylene(recycled), hydrogen chloride, chloropropene by-products, mixed chlorides by-products, and allyl chloride, each complete with reflux drums, reflux pumps and reboilers. Most of these towers need to operate at low temperatures and thsu require a refrigeration cycle using propylene. <br>
There exists myriad economic options in products and heat exchangers - only the main product specification is mandatory, and the other product specifications only need to be met when we wish to "sell" them and recover some costs, we can alternatively pay to dispose of them in which case there are no specifications. Since there exist high temperature streams in the process it'll also be possible to generate steam to use elsewhere.
